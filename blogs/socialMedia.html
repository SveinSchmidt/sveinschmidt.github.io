    <h1>IS SOCIAL MEDIA GOOD FOR YOU?</h1>
    <p>For many, social media appears to have a range of benefits. It provides a way for many of us to connect with others. We can support other people and feel supported by them.</p>
    <h3>It allows us to connect</h3>
    <p>Whether I’m standing on the tram, sitting in a café, or walking down the street, I’m struck by the sight of so many people looking down at their phones, scrolling through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or a myriad of other social media platforms. I immediately ask myself, in this increasingly technological age, what is the impact of constant social media use on our mental health? On one hand, it allows us to stay up-to-date and connected. I can find out what friends in America and around the world are doing at any time of day or night.</p>
